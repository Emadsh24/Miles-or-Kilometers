# converter_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

The measures conversion app will allow your users to select a measure – metric or imperial – and convert it to another measure. For example, they'll be able to convert a distance in miles to a distance in kilometers, or a weight in kilograms to a weight in pounds. So, next time you travel to a country with a different system, you'll be able to easily understand the speed of your car (and maybe avoid a fine), or the weight of the food you can buy at the market, and along the way, you'll build on your Flutter skills.
